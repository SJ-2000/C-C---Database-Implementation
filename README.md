# C/C++ - Database-Implementation

Problem statement:

Implement a city database. Each database record contains the name of the city (a string of arbitrary length) and the coordinates of the city expressed as integer x and y coordinates. Your database should allow records to be inserted, deleted by name or coordinate, and searched by name or coordinate. Another operation that should be supported is to print all records within a given distance of a specified point (capital city).

Ex: 

City should be having following description and should be searched either by name or using x and y (both). The distance from the capital city has to be captured. 

Name: Bengaluru 

Coordinate→X→22 (Latitude) 

Coordinate→Y→76 (Longitude) 

Distance from capital: 0 km 

A student can create a city structure with required attribute and use any data structure of choice.


Specifications and flow:

Operations required

1. Insertion of an element in singly linked list:
This operation is used for inserting the data i.e name of city and its latitude and longitude into the database.

2. Deletion of an element:
This operation is used to delete a particular data from the database.

3. Displaying/printing elements of the list:
This operation is used to display the contents of the database.

4. Searching elements in the list:
This operation is used for the purpose of searching a particular data in the database created.

5. Calculating distance which requires a mathematical formula from 2-D coordinate geometry:
In this operation the mathematical formulae from 2-D coordinate geometry is used.

NOTE:
Haversine formula is a method for calculating distance between 2 cities with much better accuracy.
